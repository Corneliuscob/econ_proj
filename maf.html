            <p class="text-muted">
                When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
                $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

            <h1>Sunk costs / Monthly expeneses / Annual Expenses</h1>
            <p>
                $$ Sunk Cost = Q * P    $$
                Where \(Q \) is the Quantity of the product and \(P\) is the price of the product
                Sample Calculation Vehicles to drive:
                $$  5 * -$30,000 = -$150,000 $$

            <h1>Operating Costs</h1>

            <p>
                Operating costs are the sum of all the monthtly  expenses and yearly costs added together minus the Operating revenue. Note that all monthly costs are multiplied by 12 to represent an annual cost.
                $$ OC = Be + B + Ad + GI + LR + W - OR    $$
                Where: <br> <br>
                \(Be\) is the cost of beer to purchase <br>
                \(B\)  is the cost of packaging each set of beers <br>
                \(Ad\) is the cost of advertising <br>
                \(GI\) is the cost of gas and insurance <br>
                \(LR\) is the cost to renew liquor licenses <br>
                \(W\)  is the cost of wages to pay <br>
                \(OR\) is the Operating revenue
            </p>

            <br />

            <h1>Operating Revenue</h1>

            <p>
                The operating revenue ( OR) is the monthly cost of delivering beer multiplied by 12
                $$ OR  = Q * P *12    $$
                Where: <br> <br>
                \(Q\) is the number of beer packages to sell <br>
                \(P\) is the price at which beer is sold  <br>
                Sample Calculation Operating Revenue:
                $$  OR = $31*4227*12 = $1572444  $$
            </p>

            <h1>Loan Repayment</h1>

            <p>
                The loan repayment is an ordinary annualized payments. The loan term is given in payback periods of months.
                $$ A =  P\bigg{[} {i(i+1)^n \over {(1+i)^{n-1}}}  \bigg{]}  $$
                Where: <br> <br>
                \(A\) is the annulized payment to pay each year <br>
                \(P\) is the amount loaned  <br>
                \(i\) is the loan interest rate <br>
                \(n\) is the number of time periods correlary to the interest rate <br>

                Sample Calculation: monthly loan repayment over 60 months at monthly interest rate of 0.8%:
                $$  A =  200,000 \bigg{[} {0.008(1.008)^{60} \over {(1.008)^{59}}}  \bigg{]} = $4238 $$

                To determine the annual loan repayment, the Annualiazed payment is multiplied by 12 ($50856).
            </p>

            <br />

            <h2>Loan Interest</h2>

            <p>
                Loan interest to pay per month is the remaining amount of the loan to pay back multiplied by the loan interest rate.
                $$ LI =  L  * i   $$
                Where: <br> <br>
                \(LI\) is the amount of the loan  repayment towards interest
                \(i\) is the loan interest rate <br>
                \(L\) is the remaining amount to pay off the loan<br>

                Sample Calculation: Year 1 loan interest paid:
                $$  LI =  200,000*0.008  = $2590.635416 $$


                The annual interest paid off is the sum of every 12 months of loan interest. E.g. Year 1 \(LI = $18321.2\)
            </p>

            <br />

            <h2>Loan Principle</h2>

            <p>
                Loan principle is the amount put towards the principle loan repayment
                $$  LP =  A -  LI   $$
                Where: <br> <br>
                \(LP\) is the amount of the loan  repayment towards principle
                \(i\) is the loan interest rate <br>
                \(L\) is the remaining amount to pay off the loan<br>

                Sample Calculation: Year 1 loan interest paid:
                $$  LI =  200,000*0.008  = $2590.635416 $$


                The annual principle paid off is the sum of every 12 months of loan interest. E.g. Year 1 \(LI = $18321.2\)

            <h1>Taxes </h1>

            <h2>Depreciation by CCA (Open Book)</h2>
            <p>
                Following Canada's tax depreciation schedule, the initial purchases of capital's depreciation is multiplied by half the CCA rate for the class
                $$ D_p = {CCA \over{2}} * BV  $$

                Where: <br> <br>
                \(D_p\) is the depreciation in the  year of the purchase of capital<br>
                \(CCA\) is the depreciation rate specified by the Canadian government <br>
                \(BV\) is the book value of capital investment

                In subsequent years, the Depreciation schedule follows the full CCA rate
                $$ D_n = CCA * BV_{n-1}  $$
                \(D_n\) is the depreciation in the \(n^{th} \) year <br>
                \(CCA\) is the depreciation rate specified by the Canadian government <br>
                \(BV_{n-1}\) is the book value of capital investment in the year prior to the \(n^{th} \) year


                Sample calculation: Year 1 and 2 Depreciation in CCA class 10 where capital is bought in year 1:
                $$ D_1 = 15300*0.30/2  = $22950 $$

                $$ D_2 = 130050*0.30  = $39015 $$


            </p>

            <br />

            <h2>Book value (Open Book)</h2>
            <p>
                The book value in the \(n^{th} \) year \(BV_n\) is calculated by the book value of the previous year minus the depreciation
                $$ BV_n = BV_{n-1} - D_n  $$

                Sample calculation: Year 2 book value:

                $$ BV_2 = 15300-22950 = $13050 $$
            </p>

            <h2> Taxable Income </h2>
            <p>
                Taxable income in the \(n^{th} \) is the income which can be taxed by the government. Drat
                $$ TI_n =  IC_n - D_n $$

                Where \(IC_n\) is the income in the  \(n^{th} \) year

                Sample Calculation: Year 1 taxable income with a class 10 and class 8 group
                $$ TI = 127270 - 22950 - 1851   = $84148 $$

            </p>

            <br />

            <h2> Tax Due </h2>
            <p>
                Tax due is the amount of tax owed to the government in the \(n^{th} \) year
                $$ T_n =  TI_n * Tr $$

                Where Tr is the compounded provincial and govenrment tax rate

                Sample Calculation: Year 1 tax due
                $$ T_1 = 84148*0.12 = 10097.76 $$

                Note: No marginal tax rates apply for these calculations.

            <h2> Tax Due on Salvage item </h2>
            <p>
                Tax due on salvage is the tax due after salvaging an item.
                $$ TS = \sum^N_{k=1} [(SV_k - BV_{nk})*CCA_k] $$

                if \(SV > SV_1\) then capital gains are taxed:
                $$ TS = \sum^N_{k=1}(SSV_k - BV_{nk})  * CCA_k + (SV_k - (SV_k - BV_{nk}))*CCA_k/2 $$


                Where: <br><br>
                \(TS\) is the tax due on salvage<br>
                \(BV_{nk}\) is the book value of the \(k^{th}\) class in the \(n^{th}\) year that the class is closed <br>
                \(SV_k\) is the salvage value of the class of the \(k^{th}\) class


                Sample Calculation: Tax due on Salvage for Class 10 & 8 items
                $$ T_S = (62500 - 6000)*0.30 + (6273 - 2536)*0.20  = $17561 $$
