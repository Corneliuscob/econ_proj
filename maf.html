            <h2>Loan Repayment</h2>

            <p>
                The loan repayment is an ordinary annualized payments. The loan term is given in payback periods of months.
                $$ A =  P\bigg{[} {i(i+1)^n \over {(1+i)^{n-1}}}  \bigg{]}  $$
                Where: <br> <br>
                \(A\) is the annulized payment to pay each year <br>
                \(P\) is the amount loaned  <br>
                \(i\) is the loan interest rate <br>
                \(n\) is the number of time periods correlary to the interest rate <br>

                Sample Calculation: monthly loan repayment over 60 months at monthly interest rate of 0.8%:
                $$  A =  200,000 \bigg{[} {0.008(1.008)^{60} \over {(1.008)^{59}}}  \bigg{]} = $4238 $$

                To determine the annual loan repayment, the Annualiazed payment is multiplied by 12 ($50856).
            </p>

            <br />

            <h2>Loan Interest</h2>

            <p>
                Loan interest to pay per month is the remaining amount of the loan to pay back multiplied by the loan interest rate.
                $$ LI =  L  * i   $$
                Where: <br> <br>
                \(LI\) is the amount of the loan  repayment towards interest
                \(i\) is the loan interest rate <br>
                \(L\) is the remaining amount to pay off the loan<br>

                Sample Calculation: Year 1 loan interest paid:
                $$  LI =  200,000*0.008  = $2590.635416 $$


                The annual interest paid off is the sum of every 12 months of loan interest. E.g. Year 1 \(LI = $18321.2\)
            </p>

            <br />

            <h2>Loan Principle</h2>

            <p>
                Loan principle is the amount put towards the principle loan repayment
                $$  LP =  A -  LI   $$
                Where: <br> <br>
                \(LP\) is the amount of the loan  repayment towards principle
                \(i\) is the loan interest rate <br>
                \(L\) is the remaining amount to pay off the loan<br>

                Sample Calculation: Year 1 loan interest paid:
                $$  LI =  200,000*0.008  = $2590.635416 $$


                The annual principle paid off is the sum of every 12 months of loan interest. E.g. Year 1 \(LI = $18321.2\)

            <h2>Depreciation by CCA (Open Book)</h2>
            <p>
                Following Canada's tax depreciation schedule, the initial purchases of capital's depreciation is multiplied by half the CCA rate for the class
                $$ D_p = {CCA \over{2}} * BV  $$

                Where: <br> <br>
                \(D_p\) is the depreciation in the  year of the purchase of capital<br>
                \(CCA\) is the depreciation rate specified by the Canadian government <br>
                \(BV\) is the book value of capital investment

                In subsequent years, the Depreciation schedule follows the full CCA rate
                $$ D_n = CCA * BV_{n-1}  $$
                \(D_n\) is the depreciation in the \(n^{th} \) year <br>
                \(CCA\) is the depreciation rate specified by the Canadian government <br>
                \(BV_{n-1}\) is the book value of capital investment in the year prior to the \(n^{th} \) year


                Sample calculation: Year 1 and 2 Depreciation in CCA class 10 where capital is bought in year 1:
                $$ D_1 = 15300*0.30/2  = $22950 $$

                $$ D_2 = 130050*0.30  = $39015 $$

            <br />

            <h2>Book value (Open Book)</h2>
            <p>
                The book value in the \(n^{th} \) year \(BV_n\) is calculated by the book value of the previous year minus the depreciation
                $$ BV_n = BV_{n-1} - D_n  $$

                Sample calculation: Year 2 book value:

                $$ BV_2 = 15300-22950 = $13050 $$

                Taxable income in the \(n^{th} \) is the income which can be taxed by the government. Drat
                $$ TI_n =  IC_n - D_n $$

                Where \(IC_n\) is the income in the  \(n^{th} \) year

                Sample Calculation: Year 1 taxable income with a class 10 and class 8 group
                $$ TI = 127270 - 22950 - 1851   = $84148 $$

            </p>

            <br />

            <h2> Tax Due </h2>
            <p>
                Tax due is the amount of tax owed to the government in the \(n^{th} \) year
                $$ T_n =  TI_n * Tr $$

                Where Tr is the compounded provincial and govenrment tax rate

                Sample Calculation: Year 1 tax due
                $$ T_1 = 84148*0.12 = 10097.76 $$

                Note: No marginal tax rates apply for these calculations.

            <h2> Tax Due on Salvage item </h2>
            <p>
                Tax due on salvage is the tax due after salvaging an item.

                if \(SV > SV_1\) then capital gains are taxed:
                $$ TS = \sum^N_{k=1}(SSV_k - BV_{nk})  * CCA_k + (SV_k - (SV_k - BV_{nk}))*CCA_k/2 $$

                \(BV_{nk}\) is the book value of the \(k^{th}\) class in the \(n^{th}\) year that the class is closed <br>
                \(SV_k\) is the salvage value of the class of the \(k^{th}\) class


                Sample Calculation: Tax due on Salvage for Class 10 & 8 items
                $$ T_S = (62500 - 6000)*0.30 + (6273 - 2536)*0.20  = $17561 $$

            <h2> Present Worth (at MARR) </h2>
            <p>

                The present worth is the value of money today you would need to invest for \(n\) years into the future at interest rate \(i\) to obtain the future value 
                $$ NPW = \sum^LS_{k=1} [PW_k] $$
                                

                Where <br><br>

                \(PW\) is the present worth <br>
                \(i\) is the market interest rate <br>
                \(F\) is the future value <br>
                \(n\) is the number of years in the future<br>


                Sample Calculation PW year 1 at MARR 0.09 (where MARR is the minimum accetable interest rate)
                $$ PW = 58964*(1.09)^{-1} = $54095 $$

            <h2>  Net Present Worth  </h2>
            <p>
                The net present worth is the sum of present worth money over the sum of the lifespan of the project at the minimum acceptable interest rate (or rate of return)
                $$ NPW  = F(1+i)^{-n} $$

                Where <br><br>

                \(NPW\) is the net present worth <br>
                \(LS\) is the lifespan of the project (as an integer) <br>


                Sample Calculation NPW at MARR 0.09 (where MARR is the minimum accetable interest rate)
                $$ NPW = -67108-54,095+56,033+52,807... = $873476 $$

                <br>
                A positve NPW indicates that the project will return more money over its lifespan than a bond/stock at the same MARR 
            
                

            </p>
            <h2>  Rate of Return  </h2>
            <p>
                The rate of return is interest rate at which the net present worth is equal to 0 
                $$ ROR = NPW(i) = 0   $$

                Where <br><br>

                \(ROR\) is the rate of return <br>


                Sample Calculation: ROR 
                The ROR is the NPW with the objective value set to 0 by varying the interest rate. using the the solver tool, the ROR for a sale price of $31 is 97.75%
