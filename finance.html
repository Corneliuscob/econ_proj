                        The total amount borrowed from <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/">Lending Club</a> is $200,000. Monthly payment will be made, and the entire loan including accrued interest will be paid back in <b>5 years</b> after the loan was taken out.
                        Equal payments will be made each month.
                        5 years is chosen as it is the longest term offered. Though it increases the amount of interest accrued, we would
                        rather have positive net funds at the end of each year in case any accidents occur that require liquid assets.
                        Loan interest is negotiated as 12% annually. Given this is a market interest rate, we deflate this value as to
                        deal with real interest rates. Deflating the 12% market rate with our 1.5% inflation rate yields a loan interest rate of 10.34%.
                        The annual interest rate is converted to a monthly interest rate of 0.824% to calculate our monthly payment schedule.

                        CCA depreciation is used for the vehicles, office equipment, and walk in freezers.
                        Both the cars and equipment fall under CCA class 10 which includes “general purpose electronic data equipment and motor vehicles” at a depreciation rate of 30%.
                        <a href="https://www.mrappliance.com/expert-tips/appliance-life-guide/">The refrigeration unit</a> falls under CCA class 8 which includes refrigeration equipment.
                        Equipment follows open book depreciation until sold. The refrigeration units are sold after 10 years for $2,000 each and new versions purchased.
                        Ten years is determined for these units because we deemed it necessary to buy a third fridge as our customer base continues to increase.
                        As most refrigeration units have a mean lifetime of <a href="https://homeguides.sfgate.com/expected-life-refrigerator-88577.html?fbclid=IwAR13m4DWc52KkI6AsGoFUFwnpZBvu_IRfau7_5V8Fxhl8X4Yjsn-1WsTLwE">14 years</a>, it is decided to replace the existing fridges, so they all have the same age.
                        The cars are sold after 12 years for $5,000 each. The lifetime of the Toyota Prius C is determined from a <a href="https://usedfirst.com/cars/toyota/prius/">used car site</a> that has a depreciation schedule for each year of car.
                        They estimate the mean lifetime to be 12 years, so we set that as our economic lifetime. After the sale of all 5 cars in year 12, 5 more cars of the same make and model are purchased (this assumes that the new cars have a 12-year life time) for the same price as we are considering all cash flows in real dollars.
                        In Year 20, we plan to sell all our assets including the fridges, vehicles, and office equipment. The fridges will again be sold off for $2,000, like the last pair.
                        The cars and office equipment are anticipated to sell for $60,000 and $2,500 respectively. Due to this being closed books, we investigate the book value of each class and see if any more taxes need to be paid. Since both classes are sold for more than their book value, this results in recaptured CCA.
                        After paying these taxes, a net salvage for all our assets comes out to $50,939.

                        The yearly breakdowns can be seen in an excel document <a href="data/cash_flow.xlsm">here</a>. This sheet breaks down the various expenses and profits made in each year and the corresponding net profits and after-tax cash flows. As seen, World of BeerCraft never profits more than $500,000 in a single year, so it classifies as a small business.
                        This means provincial and federal tax are only 2% and 10% respectively. After paying taxes, there are various other payments that are made. These include loan repayment (interest and principle repayment) and charitable donations.
                        As mentioned in our <a href="aboutus.html">About Us</a> section, World of BeerCraft <b>donates $3</b> from every monthly subscription to Alcoholics Anonymous. After these payments are made, a retained value can be seen that is used to calculate our rate of return for this project.
