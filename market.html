                    As one of largest hubs in Canada, Vancouver is the gathering place for many entrepreneurs and innovative individuals.
                    The craft beer market has seen <b>incredible growth</b> with new breweries opening up throughout the region including some more <a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/vancouver-breweries-and-tasting-rooms-3955014">well-known names</a> such as: Storm Brewing, 33 Acres, and Bomber Brewing.
                    World of BeerCraft intends to cater to the Vancouver area by providing a subscription based service that aims to deliver various craft beers to your doorstep.
                    With the increasing demand for craft beers, it is foreseeable that microbreweries will continue to open in Vancouver with increasing popularity.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch (BCLDB) publishes quarterly reports that report on the <a href="http://www.bcldb.com/publications/hospitality-liquor-market-review">liquor market in British Columbia.</a>
                    Between the start of 2016 to the end of 2017, we can see there is an average increase in craft beer sales of 0.5% per quarter or 2% annually.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    From this, a growing interest in the craft beer industry is apparent.
                    Given the <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/skipthedishes-reveals-109696-revenue-growth-receives-deloitte-technology-fast-50-award-656351423.html">success of similar businesses</a> such as SkipTheDishes which delivers food to people’s homes, we surmise that people will enjoy having alcohol brought to them.
                    While there are similar services that deliver alcohol to customers, none of them are quite like World of BeerCraft. You can find out more about what makes us <b>unique</b> in <a href="aboutus.html">About Us</a>.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    A report from Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer estimated that <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/chief-public-health-officer-reports-state-public-health-canada/2015-alcohol-consumption-canada.html">22 million Canadians drank alcohol in 2013.</a>
                    Given the Canadian population in 2013 was reported at around <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/12-581-x/2014000/pop-eng.htm">35 million</a>, this means that roughly 63% of all Canadians drink alcohol.
                    Applying this same metric to Vancouver which has a current population of roughly <a href="http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/vancouver-population/" target="blank">2,555,884</a>, we estimate the amount of people who drink in Vancouver to be 1,610,207.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Based on the BCLDB data, we estimate roughly 25% of beer sales can be attributed to craft beer sales.
                    This gives us a Total Attainable Market (TAM) of 402,552 craft beer drinkers in Vancouver.
                    To get a better metric on our Serviceable Available Market (SAM), we use survey data from BeermeBC seen <a href="https://beermebc.com/2018/12/13/2018-bc-craft-beer-trends-6-years-of-consumer-data-visualized/">here</a>.
                    This survey data reports that roughly 70% of people enjoy drinking in their own homes and 50% of people prefer purchasing their alcohol from a private retailer.
                    From these statistics, we calculate a SAM of 140,893 people. Our Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) is estimated at around 2% of the SAM, translating to 4,227 people in the first year. Due to restrictions in advertising, storage, and transportation.
                    Each progressive year, the number of subscribers is estimated to increase geometrically by 2%. This follows the same trend as the increase in craft beer sales annually.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Our competitors range far and few in British Columbia. This is due to legal issues arising from the delivery of beer itself.
                    PintPost was a company <a href="https://beermebc.com/news/pint-post-launches-bcs-first-craft-beer-subscription-service/">conceived in 2016</a>.
                    Sadly, they have closed shop. Through careful planning and ample advertising, we aim to fill the gap that PintPost has left.
