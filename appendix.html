                A shelving unit can be placed inside the fridge every 1.5' in height. <br>

                A 2' walkway down the fridge is kept. <br>

                The number of cans placed along the length is the length of the fridge, divided by the diameter of the can (27 cans). <br>

                The number of cans placed along the width is the width of the fridge, divided by the diameter of the can (18 cans). <br>

                The number of cans per shelving level is \(18*27 = 972 \) cans. <br>

                The total number of cans that can be stored in a fridge is the cans per level times the nubmer of shelve levels: \(972*5 = 4,860\) <br>

                the number of 6-packs is the total number of cans divided by 6: \(4,860 \div 6 = 80\)

                <p>
                    The loan repayment is an ordinary annualized payments. The loan term is given in payback periods of months.
                    $$ A =  P\bigg{[} {i(i+1)^n \over {(1+i)^{n-1}}}  \bigg{]}  $$

                    \(A\) is the annualized payment to pay each year <br>
                    \(P\) is the amount loaned  <br>
                    \(i\) is the loan interest rate <br>
                    \(n\) is the number of time periods correlary to the interest rate <br>

                    Sample Calculation: monthly loan repayment over 60 months at monthly interest rate of 0.8%:
                    $$  A =  200,000 \bigg{[} {0.008(1.008)^{60} \over {(1.008)^{59}}}  \bigg{]} = $4,238 $$

                    To determine the annual loan repayment, the annualiazed payment is multiplied by 12 ($50,856).

                    \(L\) is the remaining amount to pay off the loan<br>

                <p>
                    Following Canada's tax depreciation schedule, the initial purchases of capital's depreciation is multiplied by half the CCA rate for the class

                    Where: <br> <br>

                    \(CCA\) is the depreciation rate specified by the Canadian government <br>
                    \(BV\) is the book value of capital investment

                    In subsequent years, the Depreciation schedule follows the full CCA rate
                    $$ D_n = CCA * BV_{n-1}  $$
                    \(D_n\) is the depreciation in the \(n^{th} \) year <br>
                    \(CCA\) is the depreciation rate specified by the Canadian government <br>
                    \(BV_{n-1}\) is the book value of capital investment in the year prior to the \(n^{th} \) year


                    Sample calculation: Year 1 and 2 Depreciation in CCA class 10 where capital is bought in year 1:
                    $$ D_1 = 15,300*0.30/2  = $22,950 $$

                    $$ D_2 = 130,050*0.30  = $39,015 $$

                <h2>Book Value (Open Book)</h2>
                <p>
                    The book value in the \(n^{th} \) year \(BV_n\) is calculated by the book value of the previous year minus the depreciation
