                Risks are prevalent in every business, and we understand there is no way around that. Below, we have summarized some of the key strategic and operational risks in starting this business and how we have addressed them.
            </p>

            <br />

            <h5><b>From a strategic standpoint, we face issues in demand, competition, as well as legal regulations:</b></h5>
            <button class="collapsible"> <b>What if demand for craft beers starts to drop? What if people just aren’t interested in a beer subscription service?</b></button>
            <div class="content">
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    We have rigorously researched craft beer trends in Vancouver and have noted that in the <a href="https://beermebc.com/2018/12/13/2018-bc-craft-beer-trends-6-years-of-consumer-data-visualized/">last six years</a> years, there has been an <b>upwards</b> trend in craft beer interest in the area. In fact, the <a href = "http://www.bcldb.com/publications/hospitality-liquor-market-review"> British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch </a> (BCLDB) which publishes quarterly liquor market reviews can be used to observe these trends.
                    On average, an <b>increase</b> of 0.5% in craft beer sales is seen every quarter across the last few years. This gradual increase over an extended period leaves us confident in the continual demand for craft beers in Vancouver.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    With regards to the possible lack of interest in our service, we have run a sensitivity analysis for market demand from a pessimistic standpoint in the event that only <b>1%</b> of our SAM is interested in signing up for our service in the first year.
                    Assuming that subsequent years follows a geometric increase of <b>2%</b> (as noted by past trends) then even given this pessimistic scenario, we are still sitting above our company MARR. This ensures that World of BeerCraft will be a profitable venture even if there is little interest in the company moving forwards.
                    Please refer to the <a href="economics.html"> Economics </a> section for more information.
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible"><b>What happens when similar competitors arise? What if they offer a cheaper price?</b></button>
            <div class="content">
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    Nobody can stop the rise of competition and realistically, no one should try to stop it either. Competition <b>stimulates</b> innovation due to the fight over limited resources.
                    With that said, we at World of BeerCraft have worked tirelessly alongside legal professionals to craft an air-tight contract. This contract stipulates that partnered breweries cannot partner with similar subscription-based companies for the first few years that World of BeerCraft is in business. In exchange, for us paying a premium on their craft beers.
                    This will allow our company to establish a strong footing in Vancouver as the first beer-based subscription service before the emergence of similar competition.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    Once our contract ends on the service ends, we will monitor up and coming competition and assess the strategies they use to enter the market.
                    To determine the efficiency of their workers and services, we first investigate their website we can learn about their values and prices for their service.
                    If neccessry, we will <b>subscribe</b> to them for at least a month to compare how they differ from what we offer.
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible"><b>What happens if the price of a liquor license increases? What if you cannot acquire one at all?</b></button>
            <div class="content">
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    A liquor license is the <b>basis</b> of this company. In order to store and sell beer, as well as advertise and deliver various different brands, we require a liquor license.
                    Thus, if the price of the provincial liquor license increases, it is necessary for us to pay the higher price. As a company, as long as this does not affect our bottom line, we do not plan to increase the price of the subscription, so such an increase will <b>not</b> affect our customers.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    Currently in British Columbia, there is a government imposed <b>moratorium</b> on retail based liquor licenses until July 1st, 2022. More information can be read <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5roadv3">here</a>.
                    Due to this moratorium, it is not feasible to begin this business until after the aforementioned date. Once the moratorium is lifted, there is unlikely to be any issue with acquiring a liquor primary license for the storage and sale of liquor.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    Please note: that for the scope of this project, it is assumed that we can acquire a liquor license such that all values are reflected of real <i>today</i> dollars.
                </p>
            </div>

            <br />
            <br />

            <h5><b>From an operational standpoint we assess, storage capacity, lack of supply, price in consumables, and delivery issues:</b></h5>
            <button class="collapsible"><b>Will our storage fridge be able to accommodate the amount of beers we need to deliver to clients?</b></button>
            <div class="content">
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    Craft beers are purchased from our partnered breweries on a weekly basis. Our system is built such that subscribers will sign up for deliveries on a certain week each month.
                    By doing so, we can balance the amount of deliveries made each week to ensure <b>quick</b> and <b>timely</b> deliveries. Moreover, our storage fridge can store roughly 4860 cans of craft beer which is enough to service 810 customers.
                    Granted we restock weekly, only 2 fridges are needed intially; however, additional fridges may be required as our customer base grows.
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible"><b>Will the breweries be able to keep up with demands?</b></button>
            <div class="content">
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    Craft beers are currently on the <b>rise</b> so addressing whether there will be enough supply is a risk we consider. 
                    The Service Attainable Market (SAM), is based on the present demand for craft beer in Vancouver which is evidently being met.
                    Thus, supply is not an issue for the craft beer industry on a whole. 
                    As we plan to partner with majority of the breweries as to provide a large range of options, it is unlikely that supply will be an issue.
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible"><b>What if the price in craft brews increase? Price of gas?</b></button>
            <div class="content">
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    Our cash models use <i>real</i> numbers addressing all values with regards to their value in <i>today</i> dollars. This model assumes that changes in costs and benefits increase at the same rate effectively, deflating the cash flow.
                    In other words, even with inflation, our company still turns a profit.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    A quick sensitivity test for the price of gas has been performed assuming sudden spikes not due to inflation such as a crash in gas reserves causing the price to <b>skyrocket</b> were to occur.
                    This analysis found that variations in the price of gas had little effect on our profitability. For the price of craft beer, the price of 6 cans is overestimated greatly not only to account for the premium we plan to pay in the first few years (see strategic risks) but to account for <b>unexpected</b> changes in price or liquor taxes.
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible"><b>What if drivers get into an accident? How do we accommodate absent drivers?</b></button>
            <div class="content">
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    According to ICBC statistics, the 5 year average for reported crashes is <b>200,000</b> and can be seen <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yygo4dym">here</a>.
                    It can be expected that a car accident is likely to happen at some point during the operation of our business. To reduce this chance, all delivery drivers will submit a driver’s abstract during the application process, and we will only consider those who have clean abstracts.
                    Again, this only reduces the risk, as such, all company vehicles will have good insurance policies and any repairs not covered by insurance will be covered by the working capital injected into the company.
                </p>
<p></p>
                <p>
                    Delivery routes are planned every week and each driver is assigned a certain sector to deliver to. If a driver is unavailable to make their deliveries, drivers who are adjacent to their delivery sector will be able to make up for their route.
                    This allows us to accommodate deliveries if one driver is absent. If multiple drivers are unavailable, we can hire a <b>temporary</b> delivery worker for this position as minimal training is required aside from some background checks.
                </p>
