                            World of BeerCraft is projected to be a small scale business focused on convenience and delivery.
                            To ensure efficient and sustainable transportation, we plan to purchase 5, <b>2019 Toyota Prius C</b> to deliver craft beers to our customers.
                            The Prius C is chosen over conventional gas powered vehicles due to the fuel economy and hybrid design which greatly reduces GHG emissions.
                            It is anticipated around <b>$30,000</b> will be required for each vehicle.
                            This high cost is associated with insulating the car, namely the trunk to ensure the beers remain chilled during delivery.
                            The second piece of equipment that will be required is storage fridges. As we buy our supply of craft beers weekly, we want to ensure they stay chilled before they are delivered.
                            The <b>Kolpak QS7-066-FT</b> is chosen given the quick shipping eligibility and ease of assembly.
                            Additionally, Kolpak sells shelving units that coincide with this fridge that we can use to store cans of craft beer.
                            A calculation of the total storage capacity of each fridge can be seen in the <a href="appendix.html">appendix</a>.
                            Each fridge stores 4,860 cans of craft beer, or 810 orders.
                            These walk in coolers are to be installed in the home of one of the founders, eliminating the need to rent storage space.
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>
                            With respect to personnel, including the three founders, there will be a total of <b>5 workers</b> to begin with.
                            Each person will be responsible for logistics, deliveries, and door-to-door marketing in the early years.
                            Hourly wage is set at 17 dollars an hour with roughly 20 hours of work per week.
                            Once business has stabilized, the founders will be responsible for logistics and deliveries whereas the other 2 employees will only be responsible for deliveries.
                            Eventually, the founders will focus completely on logistics and more delivery personnel will be hired to accommodate.
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>
                            Other assets that will be required include a <b>liquor license, the craft beer, advertising rights, and packaging.</b>
                            The initial liquor license costs $4,400 with a discounted renewal fee based on the value of alcohol bought in the previous year.
                            6-pack of craft beer are estimated to cost $20 due to the premium being paid to monopolize this business model for the first few years as well as advertise our brand at the brewery.
                            To ensure we have a strong subscriber base in the first year the company begins, investments into advertising in year 0 will be made.
                            This includes renting out 2 billboards in Vancouver to advertise our business. Finally, we have special packaging with our logo to promote business.
                            The packaging will be a cardboard based holder to prevent plastic from ending up in the landfill.

                        To begin this venture, there are various expenses, totaling $267,108. Due to this large cost, we plan to acquire a small business loan from <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/business/?utm_source=LC&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=pl_top_nav&u=1"> Lending Club </a> for $200,000.
                        This loan will be paid back over a 5 year term with a market interest rate of 12% compounded annually.
                        Monthly payments are made at a real interest rate of 0.82%. Due to the length of the term, we anticipate a 5% origination fee of $10,000 will be required.
                        The other $, which is mainly the working capital will be covered using the founders’ own savings.

                        Below is a cash flow diagram of our before-tax cash flow (BTCF). This takes into account, operational costs (advertising, gas, insurance, and beer costs) and new equipment costs.
                        Revenue is generated from the sale of beer as well as the salvage of vehicles. The <i>change layout</i> button switches between the net BTCF and compares them between revenue and expenses.
