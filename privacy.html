                    Vancouver is a hub for the go-getters. Innovation and entrepreneurship flourish, likewise demand for the unique, demand for the niche is always wanted [some article on startup culture].
                    The craft beer market has seen incredible growth with new breweries springing up throughout the region. World of Beercraft intends to service the Vancouver and North Shore region of British Colombia with a target serviceable obtainable market of ~2800 people in the initial years, growing to ~4800 people in the later years.
                    We recognize an economic niche to be satisfied in this vibrant city and the need to be socially responsible. As such, we propose to support responsible drinking through donations to Alcoholics Anonymous and other organizations promoting Wellness.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Our competitors range far and few in British Colombia. This is due to legal issues arising from the delivery of beer itself.
                    PintPost was company <a href="https://beermebc.com/news/pint-post-launches-bcs-first-craft-beer-subscription-service/">conceived in 2016.</a>
                    Sadly, they have closed shop.  Through careful planning and logistics, we aim to fill the gap that PintPost has left for us and meet the demand that our city has for us.
